# Introduction
Welcome to our Plant Classification Web Application aka AushadHub! This app uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images of plants.


## AushadHub Overview 🌿 :
AushadHub is a project designed to address the challenge of identifying medicinal herbs. It utilizes a Machine Learning Model based on ResNet, achieving a validation accuracy of 98% and a testing accuracy of 96%. The dataset used for training and testing comprises over 1500 images spanning 30 different medicinal herb species.

## Description:
### FrontEnd:
The front end of AushadHub is developed using Flask, HTML, CSS, and a touch of vanilla JavaScript.

### Backend:
The backend consists of an end-to-end Machine Learning solution dedicated to solving the problem of medicinal herb identification. It employs ResNet trained on a custom dataset, achieving a validation accuracy of 98%. The dataset used for training and testing consists of over 1500 images representing 30 different medicinal herb species.
